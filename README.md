## Motivation
This is a personal project of mine that I am currently working on!

## Technologies Used
I am using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and React for this project. I also created a layout design on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2H9rGOp4az8aFCfiiVBRze/Portfolio?node-id=0%3A1&t=AjGhtjE3x2taMJdv-0).
